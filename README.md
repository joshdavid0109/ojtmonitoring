# OJT (On-the-Job Training) Monitoring System

The Web-Based OJT (On-the-Job Training) Monitoring System is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline the management and monitoring of on-the-job training activities within an organization. Tailored to meet the specific needs of both students undergoing training and supervisors overseeing their progress, this system provides a centralized hub for tracking tasks, progress reports, and feedback.

Key Features:

- User Authentication and Management: Secure authentication system for students, supervisors, and administrators. User management functionalities to create, update, and delete user accounts.
- Task Assignment and Tracking: Supervisors can assign tasks to students, specifying details such as task description, deadline, and priority. Students can view assigned tasks, mark them as complete, and provide status updates.
- Progress Monitoring and Reporting: Supervisors can monitor the progress of students' tasks in real-time, track completed tasks, and review progress reports. Students can submit progress reports detailing their activities, accomplishments, challenges, and future plans.
- Feedback and Evaluation: Supervisors can provide feedback and constructive criticism to students on their performance and progress. Students can respond to feedback, seek clarification, and request guidance as needed.
- Document Management: Centralized repository for storing training-related documents, resources, guidelines, and templates.
Secure access control mechanisms to ensure confidentiality and data integrity.
Notifications and Reminders:Automated notifications and reminders to students and supervisors for upcoming deadlines, overdue tasks, and important updates. Customizable notification settings for individual users.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Authors and acknowledgment

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
